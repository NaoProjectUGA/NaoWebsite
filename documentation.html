		<h1>Classroom Guide</h1>
		<br>
		<p>The following are some notes I have about using NAO to assist learning in the classroom. This includes a brief outline of how I did my classroom demos, as well as a list of
			things that I thought really captured the students attention while I showed them NAO.</p>
   
   
		<br>
		<h1>Demo Material To Capture Attention</h1>
		<br>
		<p>	After doing a handful of classroom demonstrations to students in introductory Computer Science courses, I have noticed a few specific things that always make the students perk up doing demos. The 
		first thing that always really gets their attention is the speaking/conversing with NAO. While it isn't as good as Siri or Cortana on their phones, I think that it means something special when it's coming
		from a humanoid robot instead of a cell phone. I have listed some sample commands below in the demo outline section.  </p>
		
		<p>The second thing that I've noticed students really enjoy is having NAO stand up, sit down, or especially when he is laying on his back and he picks himself up. This is the time when most students take
		out their cell phones and start taking pictures/videos of NAO (which is pretty cool). You can actually really tie this section in with the voice commands, as you can tell NAO to sit down/stand up. For having him
		get up from laying on his back, you can just have him stand up, and then gently lower him onto his back. He will sense that he is laying down, and try and fix himself automatically. </p>
		
		<p> The other must have in any classroom demonstration of NAO is the Thai dancing. The Thai dancing package comes by default with every trial version of Choregraphe, so it only takes a second or two to drag it over and run 
		it. Even though it isn't that fancy of a dance, the balance that NAO exhibits is pretty remarkable. There is something that I noted in the  "Issues" section of this website that notes how when NAO is performing
		this dance, there is a really strong chance that he will fall over. Not only that, but the chances of him falling on a surface like carpet is much greater than the chances of him falling on like a flat wooden
		table. So just keep that in mind!

		<h1>Demo Outline</h1>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Give Background Information on NAO
				<li>Talk about his country of origin</li>
				<li>Discuss his intended uses (primarily Education)</li>
				<li>Mention how he has been found to be great for interacting with children with Autism</li>
				<li>Explain his head tracking and how he will listen/follow you as you talk</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Give Demonstration On His Speaking (The Following Are Sample Commands)
				<li>"How old are you?"</li>
				<li>"Hello!"</li>
				<li>"Stand Up"</li>
				<li>"What is your name?"</li>
				<li>"Don't look at me."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Discuss the Basics of Choregraphe
				<li>Choregraphe allows 2 different ways to program NAO (drag and drop, or with direct text edit)</li>
				<li>Explain the drag and drop as well as the flow of control (follow the lines, and read left to right)</li>
				<li>Can use any of the packages included by default, or can make/create your own</li>
				<li>Can almost think of boxes sort of like methods, and the root of Choregraphe is like the main method</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Code Demonstration and Walkthrough
				<li>At this point in the demo, I like to take a few sample labs (that I have all included in the "downloads section" of the site) and walk students through them.</li>
				<li>I generally start by explaining what we want the code to do, and then we will walk through the boxes together one by one and trace through the code </li>
				<li>Once the students know what to expect, we go ahead and run it (multiple times if different outcomes can happen)</li>
				<li>Before moving on to the next lab to demonstrate, I normally ask the class how we could edit our code to do something differently. For example, if we wanted the robot
				to take 10 steps instead of 5 or something a little more complicated perhaps. We then could walk through the changes, and then demonstrate them before moving on.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Summary
				<li>Discuss the NAO community, and how you can upload projects to the community</li>
				<li>Mention how you don't specifically need a physical robot in front of you to program for NAO. You can use the simulator for more basic things</li>
				<li>Ask how many students would like to work on a lab assignment with NAO</li>
				<li>Tell them who to email if they want to give feedback on NAO or if they want to get involved</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
				Question Time
				<li>I always leave time for Q&A. Students always have a lot of questions about NAO. I've gotten questions ranging from his capabilities to the kind of hardware he uses.</li>
				<li>Students also always like to come up after class and talk to NAO for themselves - so keep that in mind for after a demo</li>
				
				</ul>
			</li>
